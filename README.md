* IET Information Security

I am also an external examiner for Open Uniersity's communications technology UG progamme.

# Biography and Lecturing
I am currently working as a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor - US) at Leeds, and as a visiting research fellow at Plymouth. Over the past few years, I have received several research grants from leading UK and EU councils, primarily to develop AI soultions for securing cyber space. Details of these projects are given below.

Prospective research students (MRes/MPhil/PhD) are encouraged to contact me if interested in working in any of the following areas. 

* Securing cyber space: Critical national infrastructure, Smart Grids, Industrial IoT, Internet of Bio-Nano Things.
* Neuromorphic computing: accelerating AI adoption in cyber security using low-power, minimal real-estate hardware.
* Digital forensics: incident response and investigation in blockchain hosted applications, securing blockchain against adversarial vectors.

# Funded Research Projects 

* Serious gaming platform for cyber security task-based training  

Developing serious gaming platforms for cyber security task-based learning, including gamified approaches to cyber security awareness and training; incorporated game elements such as rewards, visual aids, and tutorial learning mechanics to increase player engagement and motivation in modules such as ethical hacking and penetration testing, employing hacking toolkit with interactive gamification capabilities. (UKRI Grant, £76,800). 

 * Cyber Threat Hunting through Task-Based virtual Security Operations Center Assessments  

Building a proactive approach to identifying previously unknown non-remediated threats within an organization's infrastructure involving a virtual SOC hosted in university and offered to external partners as a managed contractual service for supporting cyber threat intelligence and incident response. (KTP, Competitive Engg., UK Ltd., £87,500). 

* Forensic science for the justice system sandpit - Standardized Automotive Forensic Engine (SAFE)  

Analysis of current automotive forensics practices across law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in the EU, NA and AP region, exposing capabilities and deriving a predominant set of recommendations which were streamlined in SAFE: a standardized automotive forensic engine. (ESRC, BBSRC Grant, £35,670). 

* Digital security and cyber resilience network collaboration 

Stakeholders from local universities and academic partners in EU worked together to enhance the security and resilience of digital networks including sharing of information, integrating cybersecurity resilience concepts into organizational frameworks, and establishing clear risk management strategies for systems from information and operational perspective. (EPSRC Network Grant, £11,800). 

* Traffic Classification and Anomaly Detection in Encrypted IoT Traffic using Deep Learning 

Developed a hybrid ensemble of single deep learning and multi-stage classifiers using convolutional (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for detection of anomalies in encrypted network traffic in industrial IoT environments. (Commercial Grant, Vodafone, £16,800). 

* Remote Healthcare Management using secure Bio-FET based IoBNT 

Funding for two PhD studentships by NSF and a U.S based E-healthcare provider. BNT utilize nanoscale devices to collect biological signals from environment further processed in data centers. The project addressed mitigation of security threats to bio-FET based bio-cyber interface traffic in healthcare Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) systems using hybrid deep learning ensemble classifiers. (NSF Grant, £96,800).
